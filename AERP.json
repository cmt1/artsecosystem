Over the next 50 years, the once state-of-the-art projection system, capable of screening three-strip films on its 97-foot curved screen, would become one of only two left in the world. Through the 1980s and 90s, the single-screen theater faced declining business, fell into disrepair, and was in danger of being demolished. Paul G. Allen purchased the theater in 1998 and set about reviving it. With a series of renovations and management under Paul G. Allen's Vulcan Real Estate, the Cinerama once again became a landmark destination for blockbuster and independent movies, as well as a variety of film festivals and other events, amplified by chocolate popcorn, memorabilia from the Allen Family Collection on display, and a mural on the external wall facing Fourth Avenue.</p><p>After Allen's death in February 2020, Vulcan announced the closure of the venue again for renovations, saying it would reopen later the same year. Vulcan proceeded to sunset their entire Arts + Entertainment division by end of 2020, and the Cinerama closure extended indefinitely. In May 2023, the <a href=\"https://library.seattleu.edu/artsecosystem/organizations/#siff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF)</a> acquired and took over operations of Cinerama, under the name SIFF Cinema Downtown, opening on December 14, 2023.
